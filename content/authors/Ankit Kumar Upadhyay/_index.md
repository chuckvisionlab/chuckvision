Deeply passionate about technology-led transformation, I am committed to revolutionizing our world through innovative solutions. My belief in human-centred Artificial Intelligence propels me to create safe and trusted solutions where humans and AI co-create to solve everyday problems.

Currently, as a Computer Science PhD student, my focus lies in multimodal deep learning, specifically in the realms of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. My research interests revolves around the application of Artificial Intelligence, especially Computer Vision, for Ecological Conservation. My interests also hover around addressing alignment and hallucination issues in Large-Language models and exploring the chain of thought reasoning in LLMs for various tasks.

In the past, I have worked towards expanding the use of NLP technologies to a broader set of languages, particularly targeting low-resource languages. My goal was to efficiently leverage large multilingual models to perform tasks in these languages using cross-lingual and domain transfer learning.
